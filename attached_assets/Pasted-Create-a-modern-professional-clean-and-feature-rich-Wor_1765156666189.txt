Create a modern, professional, clean, and feature-rich Worker Panel Dashboard for the “ServiceHub Pro” home-service platform.

The dashboard should NOT be minimal — it must be powerful, data-rich, beautifully designed, and optimized for professional service workers. It must look premium, with well-organized sections, attractive cards, clean typography, rounded corners, and a high-quality layout.
